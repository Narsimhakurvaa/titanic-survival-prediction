#  Titanic Survival Prediction — Data Science Project

This project is part of my **#12WeeksOfDomains** learning challenge.  
The goal is to analyze the Titanic dataset, extract insights, engineer features,  
and build machine learning models to predict passenger survival.

---

##  Project Overview
The Titanic dataset contains demographic and travel details of passengers.  
The objective is to predict whether a passenger survived based on specific features.

### Tasks Completed
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering:
  - FamilySize
  - IsAlone
  - AgeBand
- Model training & comparison
- Performance evaluation

---

##  Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

##  Models Compared
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The model with the best performance was selected based on **accuracy score**.

---

##  Key Insights (EDA)
- Females had a significantly higher survival rate
- Survival probability was higher for 1st-class passengers
- Travelling alone reduced survival chance
- Younger passengers showed better survival trends
